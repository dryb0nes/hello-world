Learning GitHub. 

I'm somewhat of a mystery. I have an obnoxiously round head with brown afro type hair. I only wear yellow shirts and blue pants. I love to say "aww-jeez" and "aww-man". My grandpa is a drunk and a genious who forces me to go on WILD trips with him. Sometimes I love it, but most of the time I hate it.
